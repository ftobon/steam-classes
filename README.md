## H.O.L.A Scientific Arts Resources

We are using this github repository to document some class ideas and resources. These classes have been taught in the Scientific Arts department at [Heart of Los Angeles](http://heartoflosangeles.org/) a non-profit organization that provides arts, science, and athletic programs to underserved youth in Los Angeles, California. 

Head over to the wiki to see the content https://github.com/holasciarts/steam-classes/wiki
