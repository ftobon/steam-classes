Click here to see the published version https://ftobon.github.io/steam-classes/

I'm using this github repository to document some class ideas and resources. These classes have been taught in the Scientific Arts department at [Heart of Los Angeles](http://heartoflosangeles.org/) a non-profit organization that provides arts, science, and athletic programs to underserved youth in Los Angeles, California. 

Feel free to copy, use, modify and redistribute any of these materials. 

If you have questions or suggestions you can contact me on github or at ftobon@heartofla.org

Happy Making!
