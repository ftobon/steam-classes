# Air Sled
**Official Class Description** : Using skewers, foam-core, packing tape, and hot glue students will build a 
radio controlled hovercraft (air sled). By creating their own vehicle from scratch, students
will learn about linking electronics with moving parts and making functional machines.
This is a good step towards making other radio controlled craft such as airplanes, boats
and multi-rotors (drones).

This class was created as an alternative to our RC Airplanes class. It uses the same techniques and materials but to play with the air sled you don't need a large area. The students get to measure, cut, and assemble their own craft. They place, connect and calibrate the electronic components. And once the craft is completed they learn about safely operating the vehicle and making repairs when necessary.

**Inspiration and resources**: 

* This class was inspired by [Samm Shepperd's Air Sled build on YouTube](https://youtu.be/lb7DPmaW8qs) with some modifications to make it easier to build and safer to operate.

* To learn more about the RC electronics used in this build check out the [flitest begginer series](http://www.flitetest.com/authors/FliteTest#/textSearch=HorizonHobby-BeginnerSeries&listSort=date_low_to_high) in particular the articles and videos about [power system](http://www.flitetest.com/articles/beginner-series-power-system) and [transmitters](http://www.flitetest.com/articles/beginner-series-transmitters)

**Tools Needed** 

* Metal rulers (some 20 inch long rulers are reccomended)

* Cutters (we have experimented with a variety of blades and so far middle school kids seem to do well with retractable utility knives)

* Hot glue gun
* Pliers

**Materials**
* Foamboard (also known as foamcore) the best kind is usually available at 99c stores. One 20in x 30in sheet per craft
* Bamboo skewers
* Tonge depressors
* Used plastic cards (credit cards or gift cards)
* Stiff wire for controls (this can be piano wire or you can obtain it from the beads in bicycle tires)
* Zip ties
* Hard board or 1/8in MDF

**Electronics**
