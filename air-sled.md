# Air Sled
**Official Class Description** : Using skewers, foam-core, packing tape, and hot glue students will build a 
radio controlled hovercraft (air sled). By creating their own vehicle from scratch, students
will learn about linking electronics with moving parts and making functional machines.
This is a good step towards making other radio controlled craft such as airplanes, boats
and multi-rotors (drones).

**Teacher Notes**: This class was created as an alternative to our RC Airplanes class. It uses the same techniques and materials but to play with the air sled you don't need a large area. The students get to measure, cut, and assemble their own craft. They place, connect and calibrate the electronic components. And once the craft is completed they learn about safely operating the vehicle and making repairs when necessary.

**Inspiration and resources**: 

* This class was inspired by [Samm Shepperd's Air Sled build on YouTube](https://youtu.be/lb7DPmaW8qs) with some modifications to make it easier to build and safer to operate.
* To learn more about the RC electronics used in this build check out the [flitest begginer series](http://www.flitetest.com/authors/FliteTest#/textSearch=HorizonHobby-BeginnerSeries&listSort=date_low_to_high) in particular the articles and videos about [power system](http://www.flitetest.com/articles/beginner-series-power-system) and [transmitters](http://www.flitetest.com/articles/beginner-series-transmitters)

**Tools Needed** 

* Metal rulers (some 20 inch long rulers are reccomended)
* Cutters (we have experimented with a variety of blades and so far middle school kids seem to do well with retractable utility knives)
* Hot glue gun
* Pliers

**Materials**

* Foamboard (also known as foamcore) the best kind is usually available at 99c stores. One 20in x 30in sheet per craft
* Bamboo skewers
* Tonge depressors
* Used plastic cards (credit cards or gift cards)
* Paper clips or similar stiff wire
* Zip ties
* Hard board or 1/8in MDF
* Velcro

**Electronics**

The world of hobby RC electronics changes very rapidly so links to specific products will become obsolete in no time. There are also many suppliers and you can get good deals if you shop around. In our case we are using something similar to the flite-test power pack B for small airplanes. For each air sled you will need:
* Motor x 1 (in our case a Suppo 2208/17 1100kv Brushless Outrunner)
* Electronic Speed Controller -ESC- x 1 to match your motor (in our case a HobbyKing 20 amp ESC)
* 9 gram Servo x 1 (in our case the HXT900 Micro Servo available at HobbyKing)

Additionally these components can be shared but are also required:
* Batteries (we use a Turnigy 500mAh 3S 20C Lipo Pack)
* Battery Charger
* Transmitter (almost anything will work here since you only need 2 channels for this project, we use a couple of inexpensive Hobby King transmitters)
* Receiver to match your transmitter

**Motor Mount**

If you have the resources you may choose to make this part with your students. Since it's reusable from class to class we have chosen to make it ahead of time. The main triangle is 1/8" hardboard MDF and the square is 1/4 inch plywood. The center hole allows the motor axle to spin freely and the 4 outside holes match the motor bracket (you might have to change this according to your particular motor).

**Construction**

The first step is to transfer the dimensions from the plans [PDF download](https://github.com/ftobon/steam-classes/raw/master/images/air-sled/air-sled-dimensions.pdf) (PDF dowload) to the foamboard. The plans are drawn to maximize the use of material an minimize the number of cuts. This step only requires pencil and ruler.

Next is cutting. I prefer to have all the parts cut before beginning assembly. This is a good moment to talk about safety and how to properly hold the blade and the ruler. Also when working with foam core there are 2 types of cuts: a normal cut when you go all the way through the material, and a *score cut* when you cut just on one side and then break the material along the your score line leaving one side of the paper intact to serve as a hinge.

After all the pieces are cut, namely the base, the sides and the rudder it is time to do a score cut on the rudder to create a hinge. Then using a blade and a guide proceed to make a 45 degree bevel on one side to allow for full motion of the flap. You can reinforce with packing tape. Here is a [quick video](https://youtu.be/w3__FHKIUvk?t=1m6s) of someone explaining the technique.

When hot-gluing the sides and the rudder it's important that they are perpendicular to the base. You can accomplish that with a simple square but we decided to make a couple of simple wooden jigs to make the job easier:

with this jig you can hold the piece to be glued with a couple of pushpins:

After all the foamcore sections are glued and reinforced glue the motor mount on the center of the craft. Also notice the chopstick between the sides and the motor mount, it is also attached with hot glue. To reinforce the rudder add a tongue depressor at a 45 degree angle:

Glue tonge depressors on the bottom of the craft to serve as skates. These work well on most surfaces.

Mounting the electronics
The 9 gram servo gets attached to the rudder with a bit of hot glue and then it's reinforced with zip-ties. The control horn is made out of a bent piece of gift card and the control wire is a paper clip as seen in the picture:
![servo](https://github.com/ftobon/steam-classes/blob/master/images/air-sled/air-sled-09.jpg)

The easiest way to attach the motor is using zip-ties. These have the added benefit of breaking easily during crashes and are very easy to replace on the field:

The ESC and the receiver can be mounted using some sticky back velcro, this also serves as a battery holder:
