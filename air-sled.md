# Air Sled
**Official Class Description** : Using skewers, foam-core, packing tape, and hot glue students will build a 
radio controlled hovercraft (air sled). By creating their own vehicle from scratch, students
will learn about linking electronics with moving parts and making functional machines.
This is a good step towards making other radio controlled craft such as airplanes, boats
and multi-rotors (drones).
