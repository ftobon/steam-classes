# Air Sled
**Official Class Description** : Using skewers, foam-core, packing tape, and hot glue students will build a 
radio controlled hovercraft (air sled). By creating their own vehicle from scratch, students
will learn about linking electronics with moving parts and making functional machines.
This is a good step towards making other radio controlled craft such as airplanes, boats
and multi-rotors (drones).

**Teacher Notes**: This class was created as an alternative to our RC Airplanes class. It uses the same techniques and materials but to play with the air sled you don't need a large area. The students get to measure, cut, and assemble their own craft. They place, connect and calibrate the electronic components. And once the craft is completed they learn about safely operating the vehicle and making repairs when necessary.

**Inspiration and resources**: 

* This class was inspired by [Samm Shepperd's Air Sled build on YouTube](https://youtu.be/lb7DPmaW8qs) with some modifications to make it easier to build and safer to operate.
* To learn more about the RC electronics used in this build check out the [flitest begginer series](http://www.flitetest.com/authors/FliteTest#/textSearch=HorizonHobby-BeginnerSeries&listSort=date_low_to_high) in particular the articles and videos about [power system](http://www.flitetest.com/articles/beginner-series-power-system) and [transmitters](http://www.flitetest.com/articles/beginner-series-transmitters)

**Tools Needed** 

* Metal rulers (some 20 inch long rulers are reccomended)
* Cutters (we have experimented with a variety of blades and so far middle school kids seem to do well with retractable utility knives)
* Hot glue gun
* Pliers

**Materials**

* Foamboard (also known as foamcore) the best kind is usually available at 99c stores. One 20in x 30in sheet per craft
* Bamboo skewers
* Tonge depressors
* Used plastic cards (credit cards or gift cards)
* Paper clips or similar stiff wire
* Zip ties
* Hard board or 1/8in MDF

**Electronics**
The world of hobby RC electronics changes very rapidly so links to specific products will become obsolete in no time. There are also many suppliers and you can get good deals if you shop around. In our case we are using something similar to the flite-test power pack B for small airplanes. For each air sled you will need:
* Motor x 1 (in our case a Suppo 2208/17 1100kv Brushless Outrunner)
* Electronic Speed Controller -ESC- x 1 to match your motor (in our case a HobbyKing 20 amp ESC)
* 9 gram Servo x 1 (in our case the HXT900 Micro Servo available at HobbyKing)

Additionally these components can be shared but are also required:
* Batteries (we use a Turnigy 500mAh 3S 20C Lipo Pack)
* Battery Charger
* Transmitter (almost anything will work here since you only need 2 channels for this project, we use a couple of inexpensive Hobby King transmitters)
* Receiver to match your transmitter
