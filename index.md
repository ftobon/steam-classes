Here is some documentation and ideas for classes I have taught or I'm currently teaching in the scientific arts department at [Heart Of Los Angeles](http://heartoflosangeles.org/). 

For direct access to the files [view the project on github](https://github.com/ftobon/steam-classes)

Feel free to use, copy, or modify these materials to suit your needs. If you have questions or comments email me at ftobon@heartofla.org

Happy Making!
