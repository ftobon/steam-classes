**Official Class Description**
Using the LEGO technic system students will build several models with moving parts. The models will be fun to paly with and will demonstrate how gears, levers, and pulleys work, and how complex movements can be achieved with simple mechanisms.
This class will be a playful exploration of moving machanisms. By making moving contraptions with LEGO students will learn physics and engineering concepts.
